This question requires a slight change to the standard F-W algorithm to calculate 2 edges (i,k) and (k,j). As such, we can put the k-loop inside the i-j-loops and initialize a Best(i,j) as infinity to be updated and store the best k.

global Best(1...n, 1...n) stores the best path, initialized to be filled with infinity;
global Ecost(1...n, 1...n) initialized to store the edge costs. For pairs with no edges or edges from and to the same vertex, the cost is infinity;
procedure TwoEdges(n);
    for i <- 1 to n do
        for j <- 1 to n do
            for k <- 1 to n do
                if Best(i,j) > Ecost(i,k) + Ecost(k,j) then
                    Best(i,j) <- Ecost(i,k) + Ecost(k,j);

Copy G three times, and connect G1 to G2 with only redges; G2 to G3 with only wedges, and G3 to G1 with only bledges. We can then apply the FW algorithm on this super graph to find all pairs that start and end at G1.

To store equal paths, we change kIntermediate(i,j) to store an array of k which offers the shortest path from i to j.

8.vb

a)

Copie Manhattan, connect the two graphs using VB. All edges that goes to VB in G1 goes to the external VB, and all edges leaving VB in G2 leaves from the external VB to G2. The complete path would start from G1, pass external VB, and end in G2.


b)

The constant c should be 8, since the graph is copied into 2, and 2^3 = 8.

The wrong placement of the k-loop would result in the algorithm calculating the edges from i to k, and k to j. It will not calculate the complete paths.
